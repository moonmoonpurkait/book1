Now, the **Doctor's table** will include additional fields for **days to visit** and **time** to represent the doctor's availability. Here's the updated structure:

### **Doctor's Table**:
- `doctor_id`: Unique identifier for each doctor.
- `doctor_name`: Full name of the doctor.
- `fees`: Consultation fee charged by the doctor.
- `location`: Clinic or hospital location.
- `specialist`: The doctor's specialization.
- `days_to_visit`: Days when the doctor is available (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
- `time`: Time slots during which the doctor can be visited (e.g., 9 AM - 12 PM, 3 PM - 6 PM).

This will help patients select doctors based on their availability, days, and time slots for appointments.

Symptom Table:
symptom_id: Unique identifier for each symptom.
symptom_name: The name of the symptom (e.g., Chest Pain, Toothache).
Relationships:
A many-to-many relationship with the Doctor's table because each symptom can have multiple doctors associated with it.
A doctor_id that connects the symptom to relevant doctors based on their specialties.

User's Table:
user_id: Unique identifier for each user.
name: Full name of the patient.
phone: Phone number of the user.
email: Email address of the user.
password (optional): If you plan to implement user login.

The **Appointments Table** will store information about booked appointments and serve as the core link between users, doctors, and available time slots. Here's how you can structure it:

### **Appointments Table**:
- `appointment_id`: Unique identifier for each appointment.
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the **User's table** (the patient who booked the appointment).
- `doctor_id`: Foreign key linking to the **Doctor's table** (the doctor with whom the appointment is booked).
- `symptom_id`: Foreign key linking to the **Symptom's table** (the symptom related to the appointment).
- `appointment_date`: The date of the appointment.
- `appointment_time`: The time slot booked for the appointment.
- `status`: The current status of the appointment (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Canceled).
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the appointment was made.

### Relationships:
- **User's Table** → One user can book multiple appointments.
- **Doctor's Table** → Each doctor can have multiple appointments.
- **Symptom's Table** → Appointments can be linked to specific symptoms, enabling a diagnosis-specific booking process.

This structure will help manage appointment bookings efficiently, allowing users to view, modify, or cancel their appointments.
